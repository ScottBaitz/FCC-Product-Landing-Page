           Our Mission is to design and create beautiful, heirloom quality, hand tools that inspire woodworkers and other artisans. Through exceptional support and education, our customers receive the same personal attention we put into our tools.
         </p>

         <p>
           LIE-NIELSEN TOOLWORKS began in 1981 as an effort to make top-quality hand tools available again from a U.S. maker and to revive discontinued, but useful, designs so the average woodworker could obtain them.
         </p>

         <p>

           Quality
           Our first priority is quality. Instead of out-sourcing all our jobs for the cheapest price and short-term profit, we are stubbornly local and believe the best quality is right here in New England. We source our metal castings from New
           England
           foundries, our wood from Maine sawyers, and use a combination of modern CNC technology, Bridgeport milling machines, and good old-fashioned hand work to make nearly 100 different types of tools in our mid-coast Maine shop.
         </p>


         <p>
           About Our Tools
           We are proud to continue the tradition of “Made in America.” Many of our hand planes derive from discontinued Stanley designs, refined to meet higher quality standards. We make our tools from high-grade materials, many of which had
           previously
           been too expensive, not yet fully developed, or unavailable in suitable tool-making quality. Our blades are thicker and harder, our castings are thicker, flatter, and more resilient, our parts fit more precisely, our surfaces ground more
           accurately, and we put careful hand work into the final fit and finish of each tool.

           Auriou Tools are handmade by a team of less than a dozen people at Forge de Saint Juery in France. Each Rasp is carefully stitched to the tip by hand—the finer rasps will take a highly skilled stitcher as much as 90 minutes to complete.
           There
           are over 30 separate operations in making Auriou Rasps of which "stitching" is just one.
         </p>

         <p>
           Our supply of Auriou tools—which are the best of their kind—fluctuates. They are often out of stock, sometimes for extended periods, and we do not have reliable delivery information. We will put them on the website as they are available,
           and
           if you do not see what you are looking for please check back again.
         </p>

         <p>
           We believe these tools are worth the wait, and hope you will too.
         </p>
